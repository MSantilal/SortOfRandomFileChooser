# Sort Of Random File Chooser
Quick solution built in order to generate a random set of files for a project at University.

Please note: This was built in under half an hour as throwaway because I was lazy to look through each folder for files. Therefore, the code is pretty messy and is quite buggy. Especially the randomisation, so please be kind! :)
